# Password Strength Evaluation Task
This project evaluates the strength of various passwords using online tools and highlights the importance of password complexity for cybersecurity.

## Steps Performed

1. Created multiple passwords with varying lengths and complexity.
2. Tested each password on online password strength checkers:
   - [Security.org Password Tool](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)
3. Noted down crack time, strength rating, and tool feedback.
4. Identified best practices for strong password creation.
5. Researched common password attacks and how complexity helps prevent them.

## Passwords Tested

| Passwords           | 
|---------------------|
| 123456              | 
| Password            |
| Password123         |
| P@ssw0rd!           | 
| U9t#L2!kWz^3        | 
| Cyb3rS3cur1ty#2024  | 

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use at least **12+ characters**
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
- Avoid using personal info or common words
- Do not reuse old passwords
- Use a **password manager** for secure storage

## Password Attack Types

| Attack              | Description                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Brute Force         | Tries every possible combination      |
| Dictionary Attack   | Tries common words and variations     |
| Credential Stuffing | Uses leaked credentials               |
| Phishing            | Tricks users into revealing passwords |
| Keylogging          | Captures keystrokes secretly          |
